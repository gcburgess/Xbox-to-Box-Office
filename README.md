## Business Problem
Microsoft is trying to enter a very competitive industry where 80% of films produced net negative returns. 

## Data
We used data from *Box Office Mojo*, *The Numbers* movie database, and *IMDb*.
- *The Numbers* provided gross sales and production budgets for each movie. 
- *Box Office Mojo* provided the name of the studio that produced each movie, so that we could select movies from the best performing studios.
- *IMDb* provided us with data on what genres, directors, and popularity of movies.

## Methods
We used descriptive analysis to determine what kinds of movies performed the best under different metrics. We looked at how production budget effected profits. We also categorized movies by genres, directors. Our metrics of success were profits, return on investment, and public interest.

## Results

We found that high budget films led to higher profits <br>

and public interest. <br>

![ROIbyGenre_barplot](./images/R2_Genre-ROI_barplot.png)<br>
We found that the most profitable genres were Animation, Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Action. We found that Horror, Myster, Thriller, and Documentary films provided the highest return on investment. <br>

We found that Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck, Joss Whedon would be great choices for high profit movies. <br>

We found Travis Cluff, and Chris Lofing created one extremely successful horror movie and would be a good choice for a high ROI horror film. William Brent would also be good choice for a high ROI horror film. <br>

We found that Christopher Nolan or the Russo Brothers would be great choices for a movie that drives public interest in our studios films.
##Conclusions
The results above led us to form three concrete recommendations 
## Next Steps
#### Marketing Budget
This is a missing metric in our data that has the potential to severely impact the profitability of a film. 
#### Popularity
This is a metric that we struggled to fully capture in our analysis. Merchandising data would be an interesting approach to solving this problem 
#### Alternative Revenue Stream
merchandising, licensing, and streaming revenue data, also has the potential to impact the profitability data.
#### 3rd Party Data
Once 1st party data is collected, a more accurate and expansive analysis can be produced
