## Overview

## Business Problem

## Data
We used data from Box Office Mojo, The Numbers movie data base, and IMDB. The numbers provided us movie grossing figures and production budgets. Box Office Mojo provided us data on studios so we could whittle down the data to only studios we would be competing with. IMDB provided us with data on what genres, directors, and popularity of movies.

## Methods
We used descriptive analysis to determine what kinds of movies performed the best under different metrics. We looked at how production budget effected profits. We also categorized movies by genres, directors. Our metrics of success were profits, return on investment, and public interest.

## Results & Conclusions
### (I'm not sure how to break this up, the example had the graphs and brief explanations of them in the Results and then the specific explanations of conclusions from those graphs in the conclusions section)
We found that high budget films led to higher profits and public interest. We found that the most profitable genres were Animation, Sci-Fi, Adventure, and Action. We found that Horror, Myster, Thriller, and Documentary films provided the highest return on investment. We found that Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck, Joss Whedon would be great choices for high profit movies. We found Travis Cluff, and Chris Lofing created one extremely successful horror movie and would be a good choice for a high ROI horror film. William Brent would also be good choice for a high ROI horror film. We found that Christopher Nolan or the Russo Brothers would be great choices for a movie that drives public interest in our studios films.

## Next Steps
#### Marketing Budget
Missing metric in our data
#### Popularity
tricky to measure
#### Alternative Revenue Stream
merchandising, licensing, and streaming
#### 3rd Party Data
1st party data would be more accurate and expansive
